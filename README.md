# Dynamic Process Simulator

This Computerized Control Project is an implementation of a First Order Dynamic Process Simulator
with the option to add a noise step function to the system.

## Getting Started

User needs to provide the the following inputs for the system to start plotting data:
- Static gain (k)
- Time Constant (ùúè)
- Dead Time (Œ∏')
- Period (T)

If using an input step function, must provide magnitude:
- Magnitude of step (Mo)

If using a file, select a .txt file with a single column providing the input data as shown in [sample_input.txt](sample_input.txt).

### Prerequisites

This project was implemented using Python 3.7.4. <br/><br/>
The following python dependencies are required:
- PyQt5 (version 5.14.1)
- matplotlib (version 3.2.1)
